# ALSCases

The ALSCases code will take known incidence rates and output total number of cases based on given disease duration and information from the U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base.  

Simply save the two incidence CSV files to your working directory and then run the code.  You will get an output of prevalence rates and total case numbers also saved to your working directory.

To apply this code to another disease, simply follow teh same format as the incidence table provided, supplying incidence rates per age group as well as the survival rate for each country.  Use FIPS country codes to organize you data.
